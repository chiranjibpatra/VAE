# VAE
The Noise Removal with Variational Auto encoder
    In the present communication we present yet another application unsupervised learning in noise removal using Variational Auto Encoders (VAE). The VAEs are appealing because they are builton top of standard function approximators (neural networks), and can be trained with stochastic gradient descent to produce the desired output. in addition to the above process it has been compared with standard fast Independent Component Analysis (fICA) algorithm to measure the performance quantitatively by yet another novel method by using Machine Learning Algorithms like Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree . The catch of this algorithm is utilized using concept of misclassification as opposed to the classification accuracy of the above mentioned algorithm
